- add other samplers (JAGS, Stan) to benchmark.jl file to have timing comparisons
- add missing functions : hcat, vcat, comprehensions, map, mapreduce,  ? ...
- add truncation and censoring
- come back to Distributions.jl since it now uses immutable types ? => need to assess performance
- optimize by priority : 
	- pre-calculated calcs (transpose), #DONE
	- identical calcs fusion,  
	- refold, 
	- +0, *1, ^1, sum(real) : low impact ~5%
	- optimize logpdf (over 70 % of comp time) ?  #DONE
- make a demo file using stats data and DataFrames
- optimize state struct in HMC and NUTS : avoid deep copy ?, use immutable ?
- correct multiple ref bug
