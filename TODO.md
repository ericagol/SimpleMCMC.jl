- add a benchmark.jl file to have timing references (against other samplers, to assess changes and optimizations)
- add important distributions : discrete : Binomial, continuous : Lognormal / Inverse Gamma
- add missing functions : hcat, vcat, comprehensions, map, reduce,  ? ...
- add truncation and censoring
- come back to Distributions.jl since it now uses immutable types ? => need to assess performance
- optimize by priority : pre-calculated calcs (transpose), identical calcs fusion, refold, pre-determine size to avoid 'if size()' , +0, *1, ^1
- make a demo file, using stats data and DataFrames
- optimize state struct : avoid deep copy ?, use immutable ?
- make examples using stats data and DataFrames
- find a way to avoid creation of a function in Main  
- correct multiple ref bug
- add progress bar
