- add a benchmark.jl file to have timing references (against other samplers, to assess changes and optimizations)
- add missing functions : hcat, vcat, comprehensions, map, reduce,  ? ...
- add truncation and censoring
- come back to Distributions.jl since it now uses immutable types ? => need to assess performance
- optimize by priority : 
	- pre-calculated calcs (transpose), 
	- identical calcs fusion, 
	- refold, 
	- pre-determine size to avoid 'if isa(.,real)'  : low impact -2%
	- +0, *1, ^1, sum(real) : low impact ~5%
	- optimize logpdf (over 70 % of comp time) ?
- make a demo file, using stats data and DataFrames
- optimize state struct : avoid deep copy ?, use immutable ?
- make examples using stats data and DataFrames
- find a way to avoid creation of a function in Main  
- correct multiple ref bug
- add progress bar
